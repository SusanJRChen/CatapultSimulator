The purpose of this program simulating tradjectory of an object being launched from a catapult.
CatapultSimulator is made by: Susan Chen and Brennan Liu for Earl Haig's grade 12 physics summative.

Instruction:
- ensure the latest version of Python and the perspective Pygame is installed
- run "pip install Pygame" in terminal if pygame is not installed
- run CatapultSimulator.py
Alternatively, you may find an exectuable inside "build\exe.win32-3.6\CatapultSimulator.exe"

Calculate Function:
You may calculate the initial velocity of a projectile given 2 different data sets (x-range and y-range) if the initial conditions are similar.
For example - given that you launch a projectile from the ground and it goes 4.5m, and launch the same projectile using the same conditions 2m off the ground and it lands 5.3m, you would have x1 = 4.5m, y1 = 0, x2 = 5.3m, y2 = 2m. Plugging this into the program, you calculate the inital velocity of 7.6m/s at an angle of 65 degrees above the horizontal. 

Simulate Function:
You may simulate the path of a projectile given the initial velocity and initial height of the object.
For example - if you launch a projectile at 7.6m/s and 65 degrees above the horizontal at 2m off the ground, you will see the program compute range and time of the path. The output displays the total time of travel, y-range (maximum height) of the path, and (x-range) of the path.

Hopes this helps!
